# Finance-Management


Personal finance management application with ASP.NET Core 7.0.

SPA application using Blazor WASM hosting with server-side.

Used third-party application Razen for graph information and bootstrap 5.

Also used a modern object-database mapper(EF Core) for data access.
In this app just used (UseInMemoryDatabase) instead of sql lite.

And also include a lot reuseable razor components in there, such as..
pagination, search-box, ModalDialog, and for list of data.
